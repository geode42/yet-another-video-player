# Yet Another Video Player

Here's a demo: [yavp.geode42.com](https://yavp.geode42.com)

I didn't like how other video players looked, so I made my own! It's loosely inspired by YouTube, Netflix, and probably all the other players I've seen.

It isn't complete yet, but I thought I'd put it up anyways so everything isn't lost to the void of my projects folder lol

This project uses Svelte 5 and Vite
